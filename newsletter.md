I maintain a small and infrequent newsletter in order to share more detailed and
exclusive content with those who want it the most.

The format of the newsletter will evolve over time, but for now you should
expect:

* Exclusive content, screencasts, demos.
* Members-only discounts for upcoming events and workshops.
* Links to interesting articles and resources from around the web.

And you should not expect:

* Spam. Honestly, it’s the worst.
* Updates for the sake of updates. I will only publish when there’s something
  worth sharing.
* Blatant advertising. I’ve always tried to avoid overt sponsorship and
  advertisement.

Not that fussed about email? You can catch me [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) instead.
