It looks as though your device is offline. Not to worry; I’ve prepared some
offline content for you to read whilst you wait for your connection to come
back:

* [head to the homepage](/);
* [read a little more about CSS Wizardry](/about/);
* [learn about the services I offer](/services/);
* [see how I helped Ocado level up their CSS skills](/case-studies/ocado-workshop/), or;
* [find out how best to get in touch with me](/contact/).

Or if you’d like to read something:

* [Pragmatic, Practical, and Progressive Theming with Custom Properties](/2016/10/pragmatic-practical-progressive-theming-with-custom-properties/)
* [Mixins Better for Performance](/2016/02/mixins-better-for-performance/)
* [More Transparent UI Code with Namespaces](/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/)
* [BEMIT: Taking the BEM Naming Convention a Step Further](/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/)

I’m next speaking at:
