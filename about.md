I write and [speak](/speaking/) on the topics of CSS and its scalability,
architecture, maintenance and more. Previously a <b>Senior Developer</b> at
[BSkyB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSkyB), I am also a two time .net awards
finalist and a member of [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/)’s
Experts Panel.

I specialise in writing and scaling CSS for large apps and websites, with a
strong focus on OOCSS, pragmatism, front-end performance and powerful and rapid
development.
