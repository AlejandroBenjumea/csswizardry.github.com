/**
 * The site’s main page-head can have two different states:
 *
 * 1) Regular page-head with no backgrounds or extra treatments; it just
 *    contains the logo and nav.
 * 2) A masthead that has a fluid-height (becoming fixed after a certain point)
 *    which has a large background image, and some supporting text.
 *
 * The regular page-head is incredibly simple, but the masthead version has some
 * slightly intermingled dependency with the wrapper that lives inside it.

 * 1. A slightly smaller padding on smaller viewports.

/**
 * Large site headers act more like mastheads. They have a faux-fluid-height
 * which is controlled by the wrapping element inside it.
 *
 * 1. Mastheads will typically have dark backgrounds, so we need to make sure
 *    the contrast is okay. This value is subject to change as the background
 *    image changes.
 * 2. We need to delegate a lot of the masthead’s layout to its wrapper element.
 * 3. The wrapper needs positioning context for us to lay our nav and masthead
 *    text in.
 * 4. Faux-fluid-height technique. This ratio gives us 16:9.
 * 5. When the viewport is at 811px wide, our 16:9 ratio means that the masthead
 *    is currently rendered at about 480px high. Let’s…
 * 6. …snip off the fluid feature at this height, and…
 * 7. …fix the height at the 480px.
