For a while I was really gutted I didn't have a [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/) invite, I posted a tweet requesting one, and [Drew McLellan](http://twitter.com/drewm) gave me one. From the off I was kind of disappointed with it. It's just Twitter with screenshots. Anyway, I wrote these thoughts down the other day elsewhere, and I thought I'd do a mini-post to share them more publicly. They are totally unrehearsed, unedited and completely off the cuff:




> "I think it's just another place where the more famous designers just pat each other on the back, regardless of what they actually produce.
It's too elitist and the more known designers only follow each other, leaving less known people following them but their own work barely been seen. This in turn fuels the cycle--the famous get more so, while the more humble designers go unnoticed. I am seriously unimpressed with Dribbble"





So, if you're really really wanting a Dribbble invite, don't worry; you're not missing much.
