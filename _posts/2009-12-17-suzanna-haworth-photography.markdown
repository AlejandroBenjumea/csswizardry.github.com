I recently completed a complete design and build for my girlfriend, [Suzanna Haworth](http://suzannahaworth.com/). She's something of a photographer and we decided that we ought to knock her a little site up to showcase her works. As she wasn't a client per se I had much more creative freedom than I usually would so I decided to exercise some CSS3 and progressive enhancement on the site.

The site also uses some custom written PHP which makes really light weight of adding new galleries and images, as well as making it pretty efficient for such a heavy website.
