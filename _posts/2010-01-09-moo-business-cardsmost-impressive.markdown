After so long with no type of business cards to speak of, I decided to design myself some new ones. I wanted to use the pink I use on the site (`#f43059`) but I also wanted to shy away from using the obvious choice of Helvetica (although it _is_ a beautiful typeface). Instead I opted for Din, which I think works amazingly well in context. I also decided to use [Moo](http://moo.com/) for the printing, and I am _extremely_ glad I did...

Naturally I designed the cards in Illustrator but my initial thoughts were to flatten these vector files and send them off to a print company to be done by them. However, after remembering Moo, I decided to give them a shot and get a limited run of just fifty cards made--this was because I wasn't sure on just how good the quality might be...

The main reason for my concerns about quality was the fact that I was to print the cards from a .jpg image, rather than a lossless vector format. However, when they arrived I was amazed to find they were perfectly legible, totally flawless and perfectly finished. Nothing was even slightly questionable about the cards or their quality, I was pretty impressed!

As well as the quality of the cards themselves I was delighted to find they were presented in a gorgeous heavy card case along with some sorting tags for 'Mine' and 'Theirs' business cards. A beautiful way to present some top quality cards.





## Moo MiniCards




As well as getting myself some business cards from Moo I decided to surprise [Suze](http://twitter.com/suzehaworth) with some MiniCards with a few photos from [her Flickr stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/suzannahaworth/). The cards were, again, top quality, presented in a lovely shallow box. She was really pleased with them! Although she is wondering what exactly to do with them, so please post any suggestions!

### A firm recommendation...




After the speed with which the cards were printed and delivered, their outstanding quality, the beautiful presentation and the sheer pleasure of using Moo (not to mention the extremely attractive prices) I will, without a shadow of a doubt, be using Moo again, and definitely recommending them to anyone who requires professional business cards or something novelty like their MiniCards. Five star service.
