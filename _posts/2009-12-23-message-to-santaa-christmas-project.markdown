Last year, the ever so talented [Megan Smith](http://stargirl-art.co.uk/) and I designed and built [Message to Santa](http://messagetosanta.net/)--a cool way for kids to send of their present letters to the Big Man. Megan provided the cute little illustrations, and I designed and built it all. Although it is December 23 now, so probably a little late to be sending off your letters, I thought I'd do a quick blog post about it...
