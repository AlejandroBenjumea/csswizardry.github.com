Quite some time ago I wrote the popular Web Standards document [Web Design+](http://csswizardry.com/web-design+/). This is quite a long and verbose document covering all manner of things from images to navigation and back again. I decided however that a more bitesize version was needed. Enter [Quick Tips](http://csswizardry.com/quick-tips/)… Quick Tips is intended to provide developers with short, single pieces of useful information that can then be quickly shared via Twitter.

[Quick Tips](http://csswizardry.com/quick-tips/) has proved popular in its short time in existence, getting mentions and Tweets from all manner of users across the globe.

If you have a tip you'd like to share just [let me know](http://csswizardry.com/contact/), and I'll add it with full accreditation.
