For those of you that read CSS Wizardry _and_ use [Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/), I have created [a small search widget](http://eco.netvibes.com/widgets/295220/css-wizardry-search) which you may be interested in adding to your Netvibes page. The widget is simply a small search form, from which you can search all the current articles on the CSS Wizardry site. All you need to do is head to [the widget's page](http://eco.netvibes.com/widgets/295220/css-wizardry-search) and hit 'Add to Netvibes'.

From my point of view, creating the widget could not have been simpler--simply writing some basic form HTML which posts to the blog will yield results, and it then just requires dropping into an XML document and placing on a live server, and linking to via the Netvibes developer centre.
