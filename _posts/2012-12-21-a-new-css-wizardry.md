* Jekyll
* GitHub Pages
* inuit.css
* Agile approach
* MVP
* Evolving project
* Purposefully low on features
* Selfish reasons (I just want to write (no comments))
* Things _will_ be wrong, things _will_ be missing; these will get ironed out
* Introduce new features gradually
* Developed openly so as to force me to keep things fresh
* Finally practicing what I preach
* Update your RSS!
