So today marks exactly two years of Twitter. I registered the [@csswizardry](http://twitter.com/csswizardry) account on March 16, 2009...

This post is to say thanks to all of you for following, reading, sharing, commenting, improving and shaping the articles and projects I've worked on over the last 24 months.

Twitter has been monumental in my online success and--as a result--my career as a whole. That account would have been useless without people reading it, so thank you all for giving it a purpose.

Also, a thank you in particular to my friends at [Smashing Magazine](http://smashingmagazine.com/) who have been Tweeting and sharing my articles etcetera for a large chunk of those two years--it is these Tweets in particular that have led to mass exposure and no doubt brought a lot of you who're reading this to CSS Wizardry in the first place!

So, here's to the next two years!
