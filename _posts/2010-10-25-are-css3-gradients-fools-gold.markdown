During a <del>discussion</del> <del>debate</del> argument with a developer today I, in a roundabout way, arrived at the question 'are CSS3 gradients Fool's Gold?' The argument itself is somewhat irrelevant and far too long winded to go into here, but the long and short of it was that he was trying to force some crazy CSS3 syntax into doing something that only a background image should be used for.

After I had pointed this out to him, one of his arguments was (and I paraphrase) 'if a user disables images I still want them to be able to see it'.

This astounded me a little, my response was (again, paraphrased) 'If a user wants to disable images then why spoof it? If they want to disable images they don't want to be left with something-that-looks-just-like-an-image-but-technically-isn't, they want that gone because they opted to disable images!'

If a user has trouble reading something because of the rainbowey background on it and they choose to disable images to aid contrast, only to find that the rainbow persists, does this not present an accessibility issue?

This then led me onto the thought that, actually, this is the same with all CSS3 gradients. I have been using CSS gradients for some time now, and they're live as we speak on several different sites. But are they such a good idea...?

Now, I am just thinking out loud here, but are they a Fool's Gold? Do they present accessibility issues? Or am I over-dramatising and over-thinking things?

Any thoughts or information about this would be great to help get the discussion opened up...



## Addendum





**Please read this bit**, I do know how and why they are a good thing, but I'm not here to talk about that...



To make clear, I fully understand all the benefits of using CSS gradients, they're a fantastic addition to CSS and I can wholeheartedly see why and where they are good (scalability, ease of change etc) however this post focusses entirely on possible drawbacks. I know all about their benefits, I just haven't mentioned them here.

Furthermore, the rainbow gradient was a tongue-in-cheek example. It isn't however all that far from the truth...
