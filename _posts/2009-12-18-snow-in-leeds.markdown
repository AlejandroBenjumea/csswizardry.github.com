Last night in Leeds it started snowing! I love snowâ€¦ it's just a real shame that we don't get it enough of it any more. On the way into work [Suze](http://suzannahaworth.com/) and I saw some nice photo opportunities but as she didn't have her camera on her <del>we</del> she missed out. We did however get a few nice iPhone snaps once we'd got into the centre of town just before work:
