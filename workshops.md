The vast majority of my working life is spent running workshops and training
events for clients all over the globe. From the smallest of independent
companies, to organisations with over 300,000 employees, I have taught hundreds
of people who to write better, more scalable, more maintainable CSS, and how to
make substantial savings on their load times.

I have a number of pre-written workshops that are suitable for one- or two-day
engagements, or we can work on something a little more bespoke—just [get in
touch](/contact/).

With a truly international reputation, my workshops have been delivered from New
Zealand to Romania, Uruguay to the US. You’re in good hands.

Workshop clients include: Google, General Electric, Etsy, Kickstarter, the BBC.

## CSS Architecture

My signature workshop has been constantly updated and running for almost three
years now, with new materials introduced as they become relevant. Attendees will
learn

* how to refine the design process to aid our architectural efforts;
* how to modularise and decompose UI components in both designs and code;
* strict naming conventions to make code more self-documenting;
* the ITCSS architecture for scalable and maintainable CSS;
* how to handle layout in a responsive world;
* theming and customising views;
* and a whole host more.
