Remote code reviews and performance audits follow a simple and straightforward
format, and have a fixed cost:

1. I get access to your codebase, and spend a day reviewing and auditing it.
2. I provide you with a review document, suggestions, refactored examples,
   screencasts, etc.
3. After you’ve digested the document, we have a 90 minute Skype call to discuss
   what I undcovered, and answer any questions you may have.

The practical upshot of which is an improved codebase for the particular
product, site or app in question, but also—and more importantly—a formal
document based around your own code which would prevent you making the same
mistakes in future. A tailored lesson, centred around your own work. For a more
detailed overview of the service, please read [the associated blog
post](http://csswizardry.com/2013/11/code-reviews-as-service/). If you have
_any_ questions about code reviews then please feel free to [email
me](mailto:csswizardry@gmail.com).

This service is perfect for projects whose budget typically would not stretch to
getting me on-site for a number of days, but do require the same type and
quality of input.
