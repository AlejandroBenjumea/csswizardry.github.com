            <p>Unbeknown to many, there are <del>three main</del> many types of dash, and one of the most common typographical mistakes is to use the wrong dash for the wrong job. There are actually <del>three</del> several different types of dash and each have their own uses. The 'dash' you see on your keyboard is actually a hyphen which is used as a 'catch all' glyph which is used for several purposes. The only reason for this is that there's just not enough room on a keyboard for so many different dashes.</p>

<h3>The em dash --</h3>

<p>The em dash (<code>&amp;mdash;</code>)--so named because it is the width of a capital 'M'--is used to delimit a separate clause in a sentence--rather like this--or similar sub-clause structures. Often used in its place however is the hyphen (-). Looking at the two side by side the difference is quite clear:</p>

<h4>Proper em dashes:</h4>

<p>The em dash (--), or m dash, m-rule, etc., often demarcates a parenthetical thought--like this one--or some similar interpolation.</p>

<h4>Improper hyphens:</h4>

<p>The em dash (--), or m dash, m-rule, etc., often demarcates a parenthetical thought - like this one - or some similar interpolation.</p>

<h4>Spaces around em dashes</h4>

<p>The proper setting of em dashes seems somewhat unclear. The ideal way to set them is with hair spaces (<code>&amp;#8202;</code>) either side -- like this. However, IE6 doesn't support the hair space leaving the options of either fully spaced -- like this, or unspaced--like this.</p>

<pre><code>            Various means of spacing em dashes




                    Fully Spaced
                    Hair Spaced
                    Un Spaced









                        This -- is an em -- dash.





                        This -- is an em -- dash.





                        This--is an em--dash.
</code></pre>

<h3>The en dash -</h3>

<p>The en dash (<code>&amp;ndash;</code>)--so named because it is half the width of a capital 'M' (an 'n')--has altogether different uses to the em dash. The en dash is used in ranges, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>6 - 10 years</p></li>
<li><p>July 10 - August 1 2009</p></li>
<li><p>pp. 40-42</p></li>
<li><p>§§ 12-13</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En_dash">more specific guidelines</a> on Wikipedia.</p>

<h3>The hyphen</h3>

<p>The purpose of the hyphen (-) is to join two words--for example 'front-end'--and to separate syllables when splitting a long word over two lines. As previously mentioned, the hyphen is often misused in place of both the above.</p>

<h4>The minus</h4>

<p>There is also a separate dash for the minus symbol. The proper entity for a minus symbol is simply <code>&amp;minus;</code>.</p>
