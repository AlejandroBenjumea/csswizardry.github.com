            <p>Things are changing... but not much, thankfully. In light of a culmination of recent events, I have decided to start <a href="/advertising/">advertising</a> on CSS Wizardry. Not spammy, unmoderated Google ads, or intrusive, unrelated and pointless ones, but single, exclusive ads reserved for one advertiser per month and for only £150. Here's why, after three years, I've made that decision...</p>

<p>The timing is handy. CSS Wizardry has just broken the <a href="http://csswizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stats.jpg">50,000 visitors-in-30-days milestone</a> and its <a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry">associated Twitter account</a> has just exceeded 2,500 followers. These followers include some of the industry's most esteemed individuals.</p>

<p>You may be familiar with <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2010/09/css-wizardry-personal-content-and-getting-things-for-free/">this recent article</a> about CSS Wizardry's content and getting things for free. Well it's true, I put a lot of effort into writing articles here and, if recent traffic and follower counts are anything to go by, you guys seem to enjoy them. I love this, this is what keeps me writing, I just <em>love</em> doing it. However, whilst I don't mind the time cost, there is the financial cost of maintaining CSS Wizardry. Next month I get the £xxx.xx bill for a year's hosting and although I'm more than happy to pay it, it will be coming out of my salaried pay-packet.</p>

<p>So I've decided that it's time to attempt to monetise CSS Wizardry. Ads will not be expensive, as they don't need to be. They will not be spammy, because I don't want them to be. There will not be multitudes of them, because I'm sure you don't want there to be.</p>

<p>An ad appears throughout the CSS Wizardry blog and associated pages for one calendar month, it is the same ad, and it's yours and yours only; no other ads appear alongside yours at all.</p>

<p>If you, or someone you know, are interested then see the <a href="/advertising/">advertising page</a> and drop me an email. This is all very informal, I hope the price is okay but feel free to enquire about special/bulk-buying offers.</p>

<p>This month's advertiser is <a href="http://twitter.com/dealpond">Dealpond</a>, a site I've used myself on a number of occasions when looking for the best prices on books, electronics and gadgets.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed that this new strategy takes off and I hope it won't alienate readers not used to ads. I've tried to do this in the most classy way possible!</p>
