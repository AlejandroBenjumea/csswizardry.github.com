            <p>I absolutely hate that I love <a href="http://informationarchitects.jp/">Information Architects</a>' <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8"><em>Writer</em></a>. Every time I use it I get a little angry inside because I just love it! Weird, I know, but true nonetheless. It's just so plain but so great that I get all these funny feelings about it, which always resolves to an envious kind of adoration.</p>

<p>I have followed <a href="http://twitter.com/iA">iA</a> fervently for as long as I've known about them. They are, to me, a beacon of what is good about this industry; they're an inspirational agency and one that I love. So, when I heard that they were working on an iPad app I was immediately interested. They'd set the bar pretty high with their other work, but I had equally high hopes and expectations.</p>

<p>Anyway, the day the app went on sale I bought it. At £2.99 it's relatively pricey in app terms, but (as I tend to do more often than not) I reasoned that £3 is less than one pint, so actually pretty reasonable.</p>

<p>I fired it up and saw pretty much nothing, which I guess is the point, but I did feel a little 'Oh, anti-climax...' I tinkered with it for a few minutes, idly typing nothings, deleting them, then typing some more. It was pretty mediocre. Or so I thought...</p>

<p>As I'd only been typing dummy text I'd not really used it properly, or to its full potential. I didn't see the point, nor did I reap the benefits. That evening, lying in bed, I reached for my iPad and started drafting an article. That's when it hit me. Writer is awesome!</p>

<p>When you start using it properly you realise that its stark UI and outward lack of features is a wealth of features in itself. Writer makes writing so easy, and it honestly seems to come more naturally. It's a genuine breath of fresh air for anyone who is used to writing on a computer.</p>

<p>I hate word processors with a passion. They're horrible, horrible things. On this basis I tend(ed) to draft any articles in my text-editor, <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>. It strips out all the stuff I don't need and leaves just me, the canvas and the letters. Oh and all those icons in the UI. And the nastily long line-length. And the awkward look of code-sized type as prose...</p>

<p>Writer is so amazingly simple, and that's why it annoys me. How can something so simple be so fantastic?! It just doesn't make sense! I paid almost-a-beer for something that does nothing! Yet it allows me to do everything. I get a little shocked, too, every time I use Writer; I get shocked that each time I open it up I am met with the same sparse interface, and yet the removal of nigh on everything allows me to do whatever I want. It clears the mind and allows the text to just spill onto the 'page'.</p>

<p>Since buying Writer I have written up every CSS Wizardry article in it. Right now, as I type this, I'm slouched in my chair, listening to music, sipping a beer and just writing. Writer is the perfect app for the iPad. It's using something very comfortable and ergonomic on something very comfortable and ergonomic. Genius.</p>

<p>I've always said that there are fewer things more complex than making something more simple, yet iA have nailed it. This idea is so simple yet so well executed that I get the oh so familiar 'why didn't I think of that?!', and <em>this</em> is what annoys me. A huge well-done to Oliver et al. Writer is a masterpiece.</p>

<p>So, if you have an iPad and write a blog, articles, short stories or anything, do yourself a favour and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">buy Writer</a>--see if it pisses you off too ;)</p>
