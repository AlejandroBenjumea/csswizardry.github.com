            <p>Lately, I'll admit, I've not been too hot on replying to emails and suchlike. If you have emailed me recently I do apologise, however I've not turned my home PC on in almost two weeks now, and it feels great. I spend eight hours a day in front of my computer at <a href="http://venturelab.co.uk/">work</a>, and usually the first thing I do when I get home is turn the computer on there. I could sometimes spend over half of my day sat at a PC.</p>

<p>While I have written <a href="/resources/">several resources</a> in my spare time, and thoroughly enjoyed each, they are very time consuming. The exposure and nice comments they bring are great, but sometimes it's hard to keep on putting in hours and hours of work in exchange for a pat on the back--that's why so few people actually take the time to do it.</p>

<p>So, having gotten back into <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/csswizardry/sets/72157617396200602/">trials</a> lately, combined with improving weather, I'm devoting more spare time to that at the moment. Evenings not spent with <a href="http://suzannahaworth.com/">Suze</a> will most likely be spent riding. <em>Not at my PC</em>.</p>

<p>This is not to say I won't be writing articles any more, far from it. I love writing articles, and as CSS Wizardry's exposure has rocketed recently (thanks to people like yourself) writing articles is even more rewarding than ever, and the quality of the comments and feedback is increasing too. I have article ideas all the time, and will post whenever I have the chance. All that's happening at the moment is I'm stepping back from the PC for a bit, for my health and sanity more than anything. Too much time at the PC can't be doing me much good. A result of which is that I haven't been on email for a couple of weeks now...</p>

<p>If you have emailed and it is urgent, I apologise. Please <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=@csswizardry">tweet at me</a> as I'm always on Twitter. I've also had emails regarding permission to translate <a href="/web-design+/">Web Design+</a>--if you'd like to translate it that'd be great, you have my permission to do so (provided you don't pass it off as your own, of course).</p>

<p>Also, regarding freelance work; I shan't be undertaking any form of freelance for the foreseeable future, sorry...</p>

<p>Keep <a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry">following me on Twitter</a> though, as I'll still be posting links and things as ever, and add <a href="/feed/">the CSS Wizardry RSS feed</a> so any articles I do write, you'll hear about first.</p>

<p>I'm not going, just relaxing. And I think you should too. Move away from your computer, get outside and have fun!</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>
<em>Harry</em></p>
