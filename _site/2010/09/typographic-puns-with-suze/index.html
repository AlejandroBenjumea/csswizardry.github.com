            <p>Today, <a href="http://twitter.com/suzehaworth">Suze</a> and I entered, completely accidentally, into an email thread making typographic puns back and forth to one another. Suze isn't a type geek by any means, but she's more than used to me being one. She's bought me books, Helvetica goodies, and even endured more than one game of Type Trumps with me. I also <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/csswizardry/status/25799545790">tweeted earlier</a> that I'd write the conversation up in here, so here it is. Sorry if it disappoints, but it really made me smile that she came up with easily the geekiest one out of the two of us!</p>

<p>Me</p>

<pre><code>[…] Certainly on the meanness **font** [typo of _front_]
</code></pre>

<p>Suze</p>

<pre><code>Haha, typography on the brain?
</code></pre>

<p>Me</p>

<pre><code>**Em**, maybe, yeah… [typo of _erm_]
</code></pre>

<p>Suze</p>

<pre><code>Em, who's she? ;)
</code></pre>

<p>Me</p>

<pre><code>It was another pun, as in 'em dash'. You obviously didn't get it though, it's like your humour has slipped into a **comma**…
</code></pre>

<p>Suze</p>

<pre><code>Hahaha, that is terrible!
</code></pre>

<p>Me</p>

<pre><code>[…] I can't wait **tilde** [dinner](http://twitter.com/#!/csswizardry/status/25813409368) later on!
</code></pre>

<p>Suze</p>

<pre><code>I **kern**’t wait either!
</code></pre>

<p>And on that note, I think Suze won with 'kern'. Bless her ;)</p>
