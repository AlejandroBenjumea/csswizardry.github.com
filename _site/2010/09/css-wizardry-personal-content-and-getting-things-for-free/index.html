            <p>Today I was somewhat surprised to receive a tweet from one of my (I'm guessing newer) followers saying he was 'disappointed that I tweet personal content from this account' and that he 'expects more CSS related content'. I'm not going to link to the tweet, because I feel that's not necessary, but I was a little taken aback. Here's my open reply...</p>

<p><strong>N.B.</strong> This article is not aimed directly at the person who sent the tweet, rather an open letter to everyoneâ€¦</p>

<p>CSS Wizardry is my own personal branding. It started off as my portfolio back in 2007 when I was 17. Since then it has transformed as I released more and more tutorial and resource content, and started writing in-depth articles. I also joined <a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry">Twitter</a> to help spread my personal brand to reach a wider audience. Twitter, along with some very high brow followers I am both pleased and humbled to have acquired, has been a massive force in CSS Wizardry's expansion.</p>

<p>Since its inception, CSS Wizardry has remained free to use<del>, and free of ads</del>. <del>I currently do not monetise CSS Wizardry whatsoever.</del> Cheeky wee ad in the sidebar. I have provided hours and hours and <em>hours</em> of decent, insightful content at no cost to my followers/readers and have not directly collected a penny for myself from doing so. CSS Wizardry costs me massively in both time writing content, and money in hosting etc. I give a lot away for nothing, and actually at cost to myself.</p>

<p>I was conscious some time ago that I had a few personal articles on CSS Wizardry which I thought were perhaps out of place, so I created my even-more-personal site at <a href="http://harryroberts.co.uk/">harryroberts.co.uk</a> to house all that stuff.</p>

<p>People like to follow people, otherwise they'd just read RSS feeds...</p>

<p>If you really don't want any personal stuff appearing via Twitter then simply don't follow me. If you <em>just</em> want web development content then subscribe to <a href="/feed/">the feed</a>, but please please please...</p>

<p>Play fair, CSS Wizardry is a time and cash investment on my part to provide good quality content for you for free. Don't bitch about it, ey? That's just ungrateful...</p>
