            <p>Zebra-striping tables is certainly not a new thing; it has been done and discussed for years. They (allegedly) aid usability in reading tabular data by offering the user a coloured means of separating and differentiating rows from one another. I say allegedly, there has been research into their effectiveness, conducted by <a href="http://twitter.com/Formulate">Jessica Enders</a> over at <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/zebrastripingdoesithelp/">A List Apart</a> which proved pretty inconclusive.</p>

<p>Striping a table's alternate rows couldn't be simpler. By programatically adding a class of <code>odd</code> or suchlike to every other <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> you can then apply styles to this row (usually a pale background colour) and create zebra-stripes. An even better method would be to ditch the extraneous class and use the <code>nth-of-type</code> selector, thus:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;tbody tr:nth-of-type(odd){
  background:rgba(255,255,136,0.5); &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;/* Pale yellow with 50% opacity */&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What the <code>nth-of-type selector</code> is doing here is looking for every odd <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, that is to say the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and so on.</p>

<p>By understanding this, we can apply that logic to create zebra-striped columns, too. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;tbody td:nth-of-type(odd),
thead th:nth-of-type(odd){
  background:rgba(255,255,136,0.5);
}&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Above:</strong> Here we target every other <th> in the <head>, and <td> in the <tbody>.</p>

<p>We can also combine the two, to create a table where every other row and every other column is striped simultaneously, and by using the <code>rgba()</code> colour declaration we can effectively layer the stripes, therefore showing where they cross over. The code for this simply combines the two:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;tbody td:nth-of-type(odd),
tbody tr:nth-of-type(odd),
thead th:nth-of-type(odd){
  background:rgba(255,255,136,0.5);
}&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Sure thing, <a href="/demos/zebra-striping/">here you go...</a></p>

<h2>Addendum</h2>

<p>After questions about browser support, I have decided to add a little onto the article...</p>

<p>The selectors involved here are only supported in CSS3 capable browser, that is to say pretty much anything but Internet Explorer. However, due to zebra-striping's negligible benefits and inherently progressive nature, I don't feel that it is a feature that is important enough to warrant full cross-browser support. Research shows that tables are just as usable without zebra-striping as with, therefore in IE et al, the user is not receiving a sub-par experience.</p>

<p>Of course if you do want to support Internet Explorer, you can always revert to programmatically adding an <code>odd</code> class to <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements.</p>
