            <p>This is just a very quick article of no real substance, but that I thought I'd share for all you Twittering bloggers out there. You may have noticed a few weeks ago I added a simple link at the end of every article in order for readers to quickly Tweet the current post with a link and my <a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry">Twitter username</a>. A very small and trivial addition, which seems to have had massive benefits!</p>

<p>The code for this very subtle addition is simply:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/?status=&lt;?php the_title(); ?&gt;%20by%20@csswizardry%20&lt;?php the_permalink() ?&gt;"&gt;Please Tweet this article&lt;/a&gt;, it'd be surely appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Above:</strong> Note the use of the Wordpress template tags.</p>

<p>There we have it, just a simple textual link with a personal-sounding message. This is so trivial that I didn't actually bother putting any metrics into place to track its effectiveness. However, one thing I have noticed is that that subtle, textual link with a polite message (I didn't want a garish 'Tweet me now!' kind of button as that wouldn't have sat properly with the way I've done the rest of CSS Wizardry) has had quite a noticeable impact on articles' tweet rates. It seems to be very very effective!</p>

<p>So yeah, basically if you're wondering how effective something such as that might be, I'd say very--although I don't have numbers to prove it....</p>
