            <p>Earlier today I registered the domain <a href="http://%CA%8E%C9%B9%C9%B9%C9%90%C9%A5.com">http://ʎɹɹɐɥ.com</a>. Or did I? Upon reading <a href="http://sam.brown.tc/entry/417/how-to-register-an-international-domain-name">an article by Sam Brown</a>, which in turn linked to <a href="http://sneeu.com/blog/2010/1/how-register-international-domain-name/">an article by John Sutherland</a> explaining how to register such domains, I wanted one. There are a few levels to this trickery. There's the 'Oh I totally understand how this works!', or there's the 'I don't want to know how it works, I just want it!' level.</p>

<h2>I just want one!</h2>

<p>Okay, I didn't actually register<code>http://ʎɹɹɐɥ.com/</code>, I registered what you might call its alias: <code>http://xn--jna6b0ca7h.com</code>. So, by that token, you find the upside down version of your domain (mine being <code>harry</code>) via this <a href="http://www.sevenwires.com/play/UpsideDownLetters.html">upside down letter converter</a>, paste the result (mine being <code>ʎɹɹɐɥ</code>) into <a href="http://mct.verisign-grs.com/conversiontool/">this IDN converter</a> and add whatever domain extension (mine being .com) to the resulting string (mine being <code>xn--jna6b0ca7h</code>). You then register the outcome, and you can access it via the upside down version! <code>http://ʎɹɹɐɥ.com/</code> is just an alias of <code>http://xn--jna6b0ca7h.com/</code> in a sense...</p>

<p>If you view the source of this page you'll see the markup actually links to <code>http://ʎɹɹɐɥ.com/</code> but resolves to <code>http://xn--jna6b0ca7h.com/</code> in the status bar when you hover it.</p>

<h2>I want details!</h2>

<p>If you want to actually understand the technicalities behind it, you ought to read the two articles linked previously.</p>

<h2>Why would I need this?</h2>

<p>You don't, but it is cool, right? Although, you could use it as a pretty nifty short-URL for your blog on Twitter like Daring Fireball's awesome <a href="http://?df.ws">http://?df.ws</a> one.</p>

<h3>Which leads me on to...</h3>

<p>You don't have to have an upside down domain, you can use glyphs in there too. Grab some glyphs from <a href="http://copypastecharacter.com/">CopyPasteCharacter</a> and pop those into the converter too.</p>

<h3>Registering your domain</h3>

<p>This is not a plug...</p>

<p>I've heard reports of people being asked about languages for the IDNs from their registrar of choice. I went with <a href="http://www.heartinternet.co.uk/">Heart Internet</a> and registered <code>http://xn--jna6b0ca7h.com/</code> no trouble, just as if it was a regular domain.</p>

<p>Be sure to comment it you buy/have bought one yourself.</p>
