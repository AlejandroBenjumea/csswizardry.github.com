            <p>A while ago I had the idea to express some old sayings in a silly, geeky way, using code and logic to express logically, the meaning behind some well known phrases. I got Illustrator fired up last night and decided to finally got a few made. They're kind of obvious really, even a non-developer brain can make sense of them, and deciphering the saying is pretty simple, but I think they're cool nonetheless.</p>

<h2>Many hands make light work</h2>

<p>There are lots of contradictions in sayings and phrases. Like this one, if many hands do make light work, then how does this next one work?</p>

<h2>Too many cooks spoil the broth</h2>

<h2>A stitch in time...</h2>

<p><img src="http://csswizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/a-stitch-in-time.jpg" alt="A stitch in time saves nine" /></p>

<h2>While the cat is away...</h2>

<h2>Absence makes the heart grow fonder vs. time is a great healer</h2>

<p><img src="http://csswizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/absence.jpg" alt="Absence makes the heart grow fonder vs. time is a great healer" /></p>

<p>This one is another glaring contradiction, so I decided to combine the two into one poster.</p>

<h2>Out of sight, out of mind</h2>

<h2>Two wrongs don't make a right</h2>

<p>This one doesn't really follow the code paradigm, but I thought I'd include it anyway.</p>

<p><img src="http://csswizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/two-wrongs.jpg" alt="Two wrongs don't make a right" /></p>

<p>Got any more that would work in this way? Leave any suggestions in the comments.</p>

<p>Also, I do realise that, programmatically, not all of these posters make perfect sense. For example, <code>$cooks &gt; 'enough'</code> doesn't really work in a programming sense... It's just a bit of fun!</p>
