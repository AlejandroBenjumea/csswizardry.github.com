            <p>Over eighteen months ago I wrote <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/02/mobile-business-card/">an article about a mobile optimised business card</a> I made. Today I finally did something awesome with it!</p>

<p><a href="http://pr.ofile.me">pr.ofile.me</a> is basically a way of emulating business cards on the web; it’s business card shaped, it contains contact details and it has two sides. You rotate your phone to switch between a bio and your contact details.</p>

<p>I’ve buit pr.ofile.me on top of <a href="http://inuitcss.com">inuit.css</a>, packaged up the code and <a href="https://github.com/csswizardry/pr.ofile.me">hosted it on GitHub</a> for you to download and create your own theme for. My card can be found over on <a href="http://hry.rbrts.me/profile/index.html">hry.rbrts.me</a>, turn your phone to see both sides of the card!</p>

<h2>Donations</h2>

<p>I never charge for any of my articles, projects, code, advice, anything. However, as pr.ofile.me is (in my opinion) a pretty cool idea for an app style project, I’ve decided to require an attribution notice that can be optionally removed by simply <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/VqTV">donating USD3.99 (GBP2.50) to the project via Gumtree</a>. It’s not a lot of money and I have no aims or goals as far as earnings go, but I think it’s a nice token amount to show your support and to remove the attribution text.</p>

<p>If you do donate then let me know and I’ll add your profile’s URL to the project’s README as an extra little thank you.</p>

<p>Hopefully people will find it pretty cool, I know I do!</p>

<p>Cheers,
<em>H</em></p>
