            <p>This is a bit of an odd post with no real point as such, so please bear with me, but I got thinking today about various things, and how I am <em>constantly</em> amazed by our industry’s open source efforts. I just launched <a href="http://inuitcss.com">a blog for inuit.css</a> and, in the process, the amount of open source and/or free stuff that was being used really astounded me.</p>

<p>So, let’s start at the beginning… I made a blog for my free, open source CSS framework <a href="http://inuitcss.com">inuit.css</a>, which runs on the open source <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass preprocessor</a>. The blog itself is built upon said framework as well as the open source <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> site generator. The source code is managed with the open source <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css">the repository</a> is hosted free of charge on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. The blog itself is hosted for free with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote the blog—and large parts of inuit.css—using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, a free, open source text editor (incidentally, the majority of my <code>.vimrc</code> was sourced from <a href="https://github.com/mtarbit/dotfiles">Matt Tarbit’s freely available dotfiles</a> (again, on GitHub)). The blog uses the freely available <a href="http://font.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu font</a> which is served from the free <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Web Fonts</a>.</p>

<p>One tiny blog, currently at two very short posts, is powered by <em>so many</em> totally free things. Literally the most   expensive single thing (speaking from purely monetary point of view) behind inuit.css is the domain name, which was under £10 for a year.</p>

<p>I’m so happy to be contributing—in my own small way—to a field that’s already so <em>teeming</em> with freely available resources, and this is a bit of an aimless and indirect thanks. People sharing things rocks. I have no doubt <em>at all</em> that inuit.css would have never happened without things like GitHub. Free things seem to spawn other free things.</p>

<p>In recent months I’ve consciously steered away from weighing in on Twitter-based ‘disagreements’ etcetera because I just don’t want that stuff. I don’t have the desire to be involved in any negativity when I’m surrounded by people—<a href="http://bootboxjs.com/">personal</a> <a href="http://jaoss.org/">friends</a> <a href="http://www.resrc.it/">included</a>—who are too busy getting on with awesome stuff that they love doing <em>so much</em> that they literally give it away for free. That’s too cool to go by unnoticed.</p>

<p>Anyway, apologies for a seemingly aimless post, but I just wanted to offer some sort of broad thanks to all the chaps and chappettes who pour their all into giving stuff away. It makes everything better.</p>

<h2>Addendum</h2>

<p>I’ve just been reminded of something else, too. <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwhitcroft">Adam Whitcroft</a> recently created <a href="http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch/">Batch</a>, a beautiful icon set that he put together over a number of weeks. Batch was initially a paid download, and why not? It’s gorgeous and clearly had a <em>lot</em> of effort put into it. However <a href="http://adamwhitcroft.com/2012/11/on-batch/">he reversed that decision</a> and decided to make Batch available for free, but not only that, he <strong>refunded</strong> those who’d already paid. I don’t know if it’s just me, but that felt like such a huge gesture; making something, dropping the price tag, <em>and</em> returning any money that had previously been handed over. Awesome.</p>
