            <p>Yesterday—11 February, 2012—I gave my first talk ever to the attendees of <a href="http://thedigitalbarn.co.uk/">The Digital Barn</a>, a small independent conference organised by <a href="http://about.me/mwatson">Matt Watson</a> and <a href="http://mkjones.co.uk/">Kimb Jones</a>.</p>

<p>My talk, Breaking Good Habits, took a look at how we as front-end developers often, and usually with the best of intentions, solve the wrong problems for the wrong people, causing ourselves maintainability nightmares in the name of 'best practice'.</p>

<p>I looked at common misconceptions and offered more practical and sensible alternatives in the shape of OOCSS, and more.</p>

<p>I'd really like to thank everyone that turned up, but specific thanks go to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/makeusabrew">Nick Payne</a></strong>—moral support (and chauffeur).</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://about.me/mwatson">Matt</a> and <a href="http://mkjones.co.uk/">Kimb</a></strong>—for organising the event and providing me with such a great opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/brucel">Bruce Lawson</a></strong>—for being an absolute gent, easing my nerves before the talk and saying nice things about it afterward.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/stubbornella">Nicole Sullivan</a></strong>—for changing the way I build websites and giving me, indirectly, knowledge I was able to share in my talk.</p></li>
</ul>
