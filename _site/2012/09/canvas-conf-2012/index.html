            <p><strong>N.B.</strong> If you are attending The Digital Barn later this month then please don’t look at the slides!</p>

<p>I’ve just returned from my third conference appearance at <a href="http://2012.canvasconf.co.uk">Canvas Conf</a>, a small, independent conference in Birmingham, the heart of the UK. The event was incredible; a variety of very talented speakers with very interesting talks.</p>

<p>My talk, Big CSS, dealt with managing CSS on long running, large projects with lots of developers and lots of style[sheet]s.</p>

<h2>Slides</h2>

<p>My slides can be found <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/csswizardry/p/big-css">over on Speaker Deck</a>. There was no recording at the event but the slides <em>should</em> be fairly self-explanatory.</p>

<p>I’d like to thank the guys for inviting me to speak, the conference was a great success, a very feel-good day and a lot of fun. I’d also like to thank <a href="http://instagram.com/p/PRgGQ5ojG-/">the audience</a>, who were great, and everyone who offered kind words after my talk; I still get <em>incredibly</em> nervous. Cheers!</p>
