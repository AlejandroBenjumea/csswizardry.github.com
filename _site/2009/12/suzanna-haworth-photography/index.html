            <p>I recently completed a complete design and build for my girlfriend, <a href="http://suzannahaworth.com/">Suzanna Haworth</a>. She's something of a photographer and we decided that we ought to knock her a little site up to showcase her works. As she wasn't a client per se I had much more creative freedom than I usually would so I decided to exercise some CSS3 and progressive enhancement on the site.</p>

<p><a href="http://suzannahaworth.com/"><img src="http://csswizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/suze-site.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Suzanna Haworthâ€™s website" /></a></p>

<p>The site also uses some custom written PHP which makes really light weight of adding new galleries and images, as well as making it pretty efficient for such a heavy website.</p>
