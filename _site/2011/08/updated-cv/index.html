            <p>Last week I got round to updating <a href="/cv/">my CV</a>, adding on my new job at Sky. I decided to take the opportunity to do something a little different with it this time round.</p>

<p>Being a web developer, with a strong focus on CSS, I chose to make the CV relevant by writing it as (obviously made-up/invalid) CSS.</p>

<p>Initially I actually just wrote everything out in one giant <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s just for colouring in, a little like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
/*------------------------------------*\
    PERSONAL
\*------------------------------------*/
#me{
    name:"Harry Roberts", Harry;
    age:21years;
}
...
...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So far in I thought that that seemed a little too easy/lazy, and it also came with the massive issue of not being semantic, meaningful or just plain proper markup. A CV is a series of headings and lists, not a single block of preformatted text.</p>

<p>I got to work rewriting, refactoring and tidying and marked it all up properly, and moved any braces, comments and quotes etc out of the HTML and into the CSS making <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2010/09/keeping-code-clean-with-content/">massive use of the <code>content:;</code> property</a>.</p>

<p>The resulting document is a semantically sound, properly marked up CV that is transformed into a CSSesque appearance using, well, CSS.</p>

<p>CSS is so humbly powerful...</p>

<p>So, what does anyone think? Good idea? Too novelty? Seen any other cool developer CVs?</p>

<p><strong>N.B.</strong> it may be worth noting that even though I've updated my CV, I'm not looking for a new job.</p>
