            <p><strong>N.B.</strong> The build along <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/11/build-along-1-reflection-and-reasoning/">went ahead</a>.</p>

<p>I've been toying around with this idea the last few weeks. I've decided to do a quick <em>testing-the-water</em> blog post to gauge interest and see whether anyone else would be into the idea. The story goes thus...</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was building a page for my good friend and awesome chap <a href="http://twitter.com/makeusabrew">Nick Payne</a>--the page had been designed by another swell fella, <a href="http://twitter.com/anatomic">Ian Thomas</a>. We're all pretty good friends and all excel in different areas, Ian designed Nick's site and, <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/09/do-designers-need-to-code/">as designers <em>don't</em> need to code</a>, I built it. Nick sorted all the back-end and is building it onto <a href="http://jaoss.org">JAOSS</a>.</p>

<p><strong>N.B.</strong> Ian can and does actually code, but for this project we all wanted a slice of the action so, in this case, he didn't...</p>

<p>Anyway, I always build static HTML files in my <a href="http://db.tt/9mQuY9k">Dropbox</a> <em>public</em> directory as people can have a quick look at it if I need to share it, plus I can test it on a variety of browsers on different devices. I gave Nick the URL early on and told him I was about to get to work...</p>

<p>An hour or so later I got a text from Nick saying that he was loving seeing the progress with every refresh, which I also thought was pretty cool.</p>

<p>Enter my idea... a live build-along!</p>

<p>The idea I'm toying with is that people (it could be pretty much anyone) get in touch (somehow) with PSDs they need building; a PSD that they were going to get their staff in their agency to do, or that they were going to give out to a freelancer, anything, and I will pick one and build it for free on the provision I can build it in my public directory and that people can watch along as I code away.</p>

<p>There are obviously some massive requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People would actually want to watch me code a page up; I feel I may be being terribly big-headed in assuming people might actually want to watch me code.</p></li>
<li><p>The PSD is all above board, doesn't break any NDAs etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Whoever gets 'picked' doesn't mind their work being made wholly public from the outset.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The outcomes would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Someone gets a free template (one page) built.</p></li>
<li><p>People who wouldn't die of boredom get to follow along as I build a page (I seriously think the idea of seeing how someone tackles a build would be really cool, it'd be like watching TV and yelling along: 'Clear your floats!!!')</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So basically:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People submit PSDs.</p></li>
<li><p>I choose one.</p></li>
<li><p>I pick an evening to build it.</p></li>
<li><p>I share the URL on Twitter and in a blog post.</p></li>
<li><p>People can keep the tab open and keep dipping in-and-out as I build, watching the progress.</p></li>
<li><p>For people not in the right time-zone I could potentially record the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>I finish and hand back a fully coded single-page.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Naturally there would be some informal terms and conditions that I'd iron out nearer the time but for now, anyone interested?</p>

<p>Lemme know!
