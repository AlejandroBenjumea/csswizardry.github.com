            <p>You may remember me Dribbbling <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/99264-Secret-project">a couple</a> <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/99266-Secret-project-02">of shots</a> last month about a 'secret project' I've been working on. Well, it's here! <a href="/in-focus/">in:focus</a> is simply a micro-site that aims to interview some of the web's best.</p>

<p><a href="/in-focus/"><img src="http://csswizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/in-focus.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The site took me about three hours from concept to first phase, then about an hour to port it over to WordPress, so about 4-5 hours in total. I'm pretty pleased with the design, and it has a tablet and mobile version, too.</p>

<p>Even more exciting than that, however, is my first guest. None other than <a href="http://twitter.com/iA">Oliver Reichenstein</a>--owner of international agency <a href="http://informationarchitects.jp/">Information Architects</a> and brains behind <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/writer-for-ipad/">Writer</a>! Head over to read <a href="/in-focus/oliver-reichenstein/">my Q&A; with him</a>.</p>

<p>in:focus has no fixed publishing schedule, and if you have any suggestions for interviewees then please let me know. Any feedback would also be great; as I said this project was purposefully 'rushed' as I wanted to see how quickly I could turn an idea into a reality. Many thanks to Oliver for helping this happen.</p>

<p>Enjoy, I hope...</p>
