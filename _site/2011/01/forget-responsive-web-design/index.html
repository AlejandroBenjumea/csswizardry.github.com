            <p>...you need <em>adaptive</em> web design.</p>

<p>I now completely disagree with nigh-on all of the below. I've decided to leave this post for posterity, but I no longer stand by it.</p>

<p>The web has been abuzz recently over the advent of responsive web design. Pioneered mostly by <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">Ethan Marcotte</a>, the concept is fantastic. It truly is great and has changed how a lot of projects and builds take shape. Things don't get much more efficient than a write-once view-many approach, and with the sharp rise in mobile and tablet devices it is proving very popular.</p>

<p>It is however, like most things, not without its downsides. <a href="http://www.cloudfour.com/css-media-query-for-mobile-is-fools-gold/">This article</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/grigs">Jason Grigsby</a> outlines some pretty valid points and <a href="http://www.uxmag.com/design/is-multiscreen-enough-why-write-once-shouldnt-be-the-goal">this one</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinsuttle">Kevin Suttle</a> offers a very interesting insight into some problems with the build-once mentality.</p>

<p>My problem lies a little more closely to home, though. The theory and concept of responsive web design is great but I think there are two problems with its fundamentals:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The name.</p></li>
<li><p>The work that the name implies and leads to.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I much prefer the name <em>adaptive web design</em>. A website should not respond to changing surroundings, it should <em>adapt to them once they've changed</em>.</p>

<p>This difference is pretty subtle but very important. Responsive web design changes as the viewport does, adaptive changes once the viewport <em>has</em>.</p>

<p>The problem with calling it responsive web design is that by its very nature it implies that it offers feedback (or a response) to a user's actions.</p>

<p>Responsive web design tends to use fluid layouts to cater for any possible resolution. Adaptive caters for a predefined but <strong>sensible</strong> array. If we consider possible resolutions we could come up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Desktop--1024 and above (current industry standard)</p></li>
<li><p>Legacy desktop--800x600</p></li>
<li><p>Tablet--768 on the iPad</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile--&lt;480 on the iPhone</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The benefit of knowing these presets (and any more that you might choose) is that you don't need to rely on fluidity (which is generally harder to build); you can also make better use of grids like the 960GS (which offers 700px that will cater for both iPad and 800x600); you don't need to worry about unsightly, overly-long measures (line-length) on larger resolutions in fluid designs; and finally, you generally just have better control over what you're displaying when you have metered constraints.</p>

<p>Furthermore for me is the work involved in creating a layout that will accommodate someone who is browsing at a resolution of, say, 913px. Why spend time catering for such arbitrary resolutions? When I build I cater for desktop <strong>and</strong> tablet <strong>and</strong> mobile, but nowhere in between; you can't be everything to everyone all the time, so why try?</p>

<p>Adaptive web design for me is a far better name and methodology than responsive design. Responsive implies, suggests and relies upon a site responding to changes as they happen. This to me is more work than is necessary. I much prefer working to adaptive web design--letting a website adapt to metered changes once they've happened--making my life a whole lot easier than building fluid layouts that will cater for anyone and everyone. If someone is browsing at a 'non-standard' resolution, I didn't ought to have to go out of my way to support it. I choose a sensible preset of resolutions and work to that.</p>

<p>We didn't have responsive web design a couple of years ago and we got by fine then. Don't make extra work for yourselves just because you can...</p>

<p>I guess what it mainly boils down to is the name. Responsive just isn't the right word for me unless you <em>are</em> making a truly responsive site that <em>will</em> cater any resolution possible; but then if you are doing that then I'd dare say that that's not such a great idea from both a time and effort point of view...</p>

<p>That said, responsive web design <em>is</em> a great tool whether you're using either method. I <em>do</em> think that adaptive is more sensible than responsive, but I'd never frown upon the latter. Any step toward more efficient and accessible builds is a win in my eyes. We just need to make sure we don't lose sight of the goal--making money. Web design is a business, and wasting time is bad business...</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/pgdev">Paul Gordon</a> shares much <a href="http://pgdev.posterous.com/adaptive-or-responsive-design">the same opinion</a>, but beat me to the <em>publish</em> button by a week or so...</p>
