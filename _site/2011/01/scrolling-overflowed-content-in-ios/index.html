            <p>This is just a mini-post courtesy of my 'brother-in-law' <a href="http://twitter.com/nickhx">Nick Haworth</a> who showed me this. It's all about scrolling overflowed content in fixed width/height containers in iOS.</p>

<p>This article was actually brought about by seeing this, <a href="http://cubiq.org/iscroll">the iScroll project</a>, which states:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The overflow:scroll for mobile webkit. Project started because webkit for iPhone does not provide a native way to scroll content inside a fixed size (width/height) div..."</p></blockquote>

<p>Well guess what, it does!</p>

<p>Head to my article <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2010/12/let-it-snow/">Let it snow!</a> on an iOS device and head to the first block of code. Take two fingers (as opposed to the usual one) and scroll horizontally. See that? Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<p>Apologies if you already knew that, but everyone I've spoken to had no idea about it.</p>

<p>Cheers, <a href="http://twitter.com/nickhx">Nick</a>!</p>

<p>Please note, this article is not calling into question iScroll or any of its code, it was simply that one quote that reminded me of this useful iOS feature.</p>
