            <p>There has been a lot of talk lately about a certain HTML5 boilerplate... <em>the</em> <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jump to the code.</strong></p>

<p>A boilerplate is a starting point, it's a base. It's a codebase from which things are built with only the necessary and relevant additions being made (note <strong><em>additions</em></strong>, not changes).</p>

<p>I won't beat about the bush, seeing the HTML5 Boilerplate makes me frustrated. It makes me wish I were a vet, or a tree surgeon, or something that isn't a web developer. Look at all that code. 681* lines. <em>Six hundred and eighty-one</em>. Hell it even takes over 40 minutes to explain! That's not a starting point, that's a finished product and then some.</p>

<p>*Based on addition of the several code-blocks on the homepage.</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<p>The main problem with the HTML Boilerplate is that it makes so many assumptions. All you can assume with a HTML5 boilerplate is that someone wants to use HTML5, that's it. Assuming someone wants <em>x</em> Javascript libraries, Google Analytics, IE6 .png fixes, IE_x<em> conditional classes and all that other stuff is </em>not<em> what a boilerplate is made to do. A boilerplate should be a suitable starting point to which developers can add all that stuff </em>if they want to_.</p>

<p>As well as all the script assumptions that are made, it also assumes markup. Although not by a long way at all, it starts building the site for you. The HTML5 Boilerplate doesn't know what markup I want...</p>

<p>A boilerplate should be added to, not subtracted from. The HTML Boilerplate just contains far too much. I can see more being deleted than being kept, unless...</p>

<p>A large fear of mine is that novice (for lack of a better word) developers will see this and think 'great, it's all done for me, just copy/paste this, I won't delete stuff just-in-case, I'll pop some stuff in here and voilà; go live!'</p>

<p>Scary thought...</p>

<h3>Gone to our heads?</h3>

<p>I realise this whole article is flame-bait, but seriously, hasn't HTML5/CSS3 gone to our heads a little too much? When did stuff like this become okay? Who in their right mind would start a project (that's not even in a framework) with 681 lines of code?</p>

<h2>The real HTML5 boilerplate</h2>

<p>So how little code do you need to get a HTML5 build started? Hardly any, that's how much:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;HTML5 boilerplate--all you really need…&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css" /&gt;
    &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body id="home"&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;HTML5 boilerplate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

<p>Copy and paste those files and save them somewhere. <em>There</em> is your HTML5 boilerplate.</p>

<p>That is all you need to begin building any HTML5 project. Need to fix .pngs in IE6? Add that later. Need some analytics? Add that as you need it...</p>

<p>So there is my opinion, and I'm aware a <em>lot</em> of people agree with it. I am also aware that a lot of people will vehemently disagree. But seriously, if you think about it, that <em>is</em> pretty ridiculous for a boilerplate, no?</p>

<h2>Addendum</h2>

<p>There seems to have been some mixed messages on my part. I'm not saying the code <em>in</em> the HTML5 Boilerplate is bad, far from it. A lot of it is very useful and I would learn a lot from, what I am saying is that it's just too verbose for a <em>starting point</em>.</p>

<p>What might be a better idea (and one that'd change my opinion <em>entirely</em>) would be to have a jQuery UI style builder, whereby you can cherry pick the bits you do want before you start building, never having to see or deal with the bits you don't.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>So Paul and I spent a good 45 minutes or so chatting over GTalk this morning about this article, my opinions and other HTML5 Boilerplate things. It was a very interesting chat and one that I'm very glad Paul and I got to have.</p>

<p>It raised some interesting points and ideas for further development of the boilerplate, however I shall avoid sharing them here because, well, it's not my place to share it.</p>

<p>Paul, thanks :)</p>
