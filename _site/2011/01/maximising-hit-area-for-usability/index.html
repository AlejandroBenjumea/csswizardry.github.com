            <p>This post is brought to you by Captain Obvious of <em>The Society of Explaining the Self-Explanatory</em>: increasing the hit area of an object makes it easier to click... Please, don't let that put you off, there's more to this article than that; I <em>promise</em>.</p>

<p>So yeah, this is old news. People have, for years, been making the target area for links as big as possible to make them easier for users to click. Hell there's even <a href="http://particletree.com/features/visualizing-fittss-law/">a law based on this knowledge</a>, but today I'm only going to share a nifty little trick whereby you don't just make the hit area bigger, but make it <em>bigger than it appears</em>.</p>

<p>First off, head over to <a href="http://suzannahaworth.com/2010/12/crosby-beach/">http://suzannahaworth.com/</a>.</p>

<p>I use this technique on the 'Tweet this' link at the end of each article. Now <strong>before</strong> you scroll down and hover that link, notice that we have something that is probably built like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;element&gt;
  If you liked this article, &lt;link&gt;please Tweet it&lt;/link&gt;.
&lt;/element&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or so you'd think... What we actually have is this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;link&gt;
  If you liked this article, &lt;element&gt;please Tweet it&lt;/element&gt;.
&lt;/link&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Can you see where this is heading? Good!</p>

<p>The actual code is this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;p id="tweet-this"&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=I&amp;amp;rsquo;m+reading+&amp;amp;lsquo;Crosby Beach&amp;amp;rsquo;&amp;amp;via=suzehaworth&amp;amp;url=http://suzannahaworth.com/2010/12/crosby-beach/"&gt;
    If you liked this article, &lt;strong&gt;please Tweet it&lt;/strong&gt;.
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So what we do here is have the whole content of that paragraph as a link--everything is clickable. Then we remove all the styles from that link so that it looks like it's <em>not</em> a link at all. Anything we set to appear at <code>a{ ... }</code> we effectively remove so that it simply looks like ordinary text. The <strong>(abridged)</strong> CSS for <code>a{ ... }</code> and the undoing of this is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;/* Define generic link styles here */&lt;/span&gt;
a{
  font-family:Calibri, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;
  font-weight:bold;
  color:#347832;
  text-decoration:none;
}
a:hover,a:active,a:focus{
  text-decoration:underline;
}
a:active,a:focus{
  position:relative;
  top:1px;
}

#tweet-this a{
  display:block;
  padding:20px;
  &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;/* Here we undo certain styles applied above */&lt;/span&gt;
  font-family:Cambria, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
  font-weight:normal;
  color:#555;
}
#tweet-this a:hover{
  &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;/* Undo the hover state of the link */&lt;/span&gt;
  text-decoration:none;
}
#tweet-this strong{
  &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;/* Make this strong look just like the a */&lt;/span&gt;
  font-family:Calibri, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;
  font-weight:bold;
  color:#347832;
}
#tweet-this a:hover strong{
  &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;/* Make this strong look just like the a on hover */&lt;/span&gt;
  text-decoration:underline;
}&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So here we're maintaining our specific call to action of 'please Tweet it' by styling that as though it's a link, but in actual fact our link is far bigger. The user sees the specific call-to-action, goes to click it, only to find that it is in fact far larger than it appears, thus easier to click.</p>

<p>Now in this example it would do no harm to just have the whole lot look like a link. We don't really <em>need</em> to spoof calls-to-actions and hit-areas here but it's quite a nice feature.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A better example</h2>

<p>A better example I unfortunately can't share just yet as it appears on a site I built that hasn't gone live. What I can do however is replicate it for you...</p>

<p>The PSD I was handed contained a section where the text was For a detailed quote for your project, please contact us Â» and its obvious choice of markup was:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a detailed quote for your project, please &lt;a&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That was until I remembered the technique I'd used on Suze's site. I could keep the 'contact us' call-to-action, but also make it a lot easier for the user to click by using a full-size hit-area.</p>

<h3><a href="/demos/maximising-hit-area/">Demo</a></h3>

<p>I've made <a href="/demos/maximising-hit-area/">a (very crude) replica</a> of that for you which you can pick through the source a little more freely.</p>

<p>So there it is, creating larger hit-areas on very specific calls to action.</p>
