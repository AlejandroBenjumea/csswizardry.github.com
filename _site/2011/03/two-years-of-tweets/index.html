            <p>So today marks exactly two years of Twitter. I registered the <a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry">@csswizardry</a> account on March 16, 2009...</p>

<p>This post is to say thanks to all of you for following, reading, sharing, commenting, improving and shaping the articles and projects I've worked on over the last 24 months.</p>

<p>Twitter has been monumental in my online success and--as a result--my career as a whole. That account would have been useless without people reading it, so thank you all for giving it a purpose.</p>

<p>Also, a thank you in particular to my friends at <a href="http://smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> who have been Tweeting and sharing my articles etcetera for a large chunk of those two years--it is these Tweets in particular that have led to mass exposure and no doubt brought a lot of you who're reading this to CSS Wizardry in the first place!</p>

<p>So, here's to the next two years!</p>
