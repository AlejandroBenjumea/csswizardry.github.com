            <p>This post comes in a similar vein to <a href="http://twitter.com/stubbornella">Nicole Sullivan</a>'s genius <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/">The media object saves hundreds of lines of code</a>.</p>

<p>An abstraction is basically removing a pattern from a specific idea and making a more generic idea out of it. That is to say, rather than writing the same similar patterns over and over, create a single more generic representation of those patterns and reuse that instead.</p>

<p>Nicole does this with her media block by taking a series of similarly constructed but different components and sharing their common aspects in a more generic way. This is a really sensible and useful abstraction whereby she can make a pretty much infinite amount of pretty different blocks of content using only the same handful of lines of CSS each time. Genius!</p>

<p>Her media block abstraction is a pretty common one, and one I've used myself. Today I'm going to share another abstraction that may well be even more common and hopefully just as handy; <em>the nav abstraction</em>.</p>

<p>I'm sure you've had loads of projects where you've had a horizontal nav, and also maybe a breadcrumb trail and possibly a list of logos that go in a banner-style list...?</p>

<p>If this is the case then I also imagine you might have written something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;#nav{
  list-style:none;
  margin-left:0;
}
#nav li{
  display:inline;
}
#nav a{
  ...
  [styles]
  ...
}

.breadcrumb{
  list-style:none;
  margin-left:0;
}
.breadcrumb li{
  display:inline;
}
.breadcrumb a{
  ...
  [styles]
  ...
}

.sponsors{
  list-style:none;
  margin-left:0;
}
.sponsors li{
  display:inline;
}
.sponsors a{
  ...
  [styles]
  ...
}&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here we can see that, although we're building three different things, we're reusing quite a few repeated patterns to create similar <em>looking</em> things. We need an abstraction.</p>

<h2>The nav abstraction</h2>

<p>Now, I'm not sure whether <em>nav</em> is actually the best word to use; these three examples are all types of navigational constructs, but that's more coincidence than anything else. As such I encourage you to please offer up your alternative recommendations in the comments, please!</p>

<p>What we need to do now is take out the shared patterns and create a fourth class of <code>.nav</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;.nav{
  list-style:none;
  margin-left:0;
}
.nav li{
  display:inline;
}
.nav a{
  display:inline-block;
}&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here we define our abstraction. We take the repeated bits and make the most granular construct we can. This will throw any list into a very basic/crude horizontal series of links which we can then extend to adopt more specific styles, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;.nav{
  list-style:none;
  margin-left:0;
}
.nav li{
  display:inline;
}
.nav a{
  display:inline-block;
}

.site-nav{
  width:100%;
  background:#eee;
}
.site-nav a{
  padding:5px 10px;
}

.breadcrumb li:before{
    content:"Â» "
}
.breadcrumb li:first-child:before{
    content:normal;
}

.sponsors{
  text-align:center;
}&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Using a base abstraction and then extending it we can create our breadcrumb with this HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;ol class="nav breadcrumb"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/about/"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/about/us/"&gt;About us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Writing abstractions gives smaller CSS, removes unnecessary repetitions and makes simple elements of your design much more reusable. Nice!</p>
