            <p>This is a really small blog post about ordered lists and numbered lists and their subtle differences.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to say something like 'There are three things to look out for:' and then follow with a numbered list with the three things in?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure we all have, and that we'd all normally use an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> to get the numbers, right? That's how you get numbers next to list items after all...</p>

<p>Well the problem here is that the numbering defines an amount, not an order. The order is <em>usually</em> irrelevant in this scenario.</p>

<p>To make more sense I've drawn up <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/sdrth/">a small fiddle of examples</a> and the reasoning in each.</p>

<p>Here we can see that, although we want numbers, we don't always want order.</p>

<p>The trick I've started employing is is to have a <code>.numbered</code> class which I can apply to a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> to make it mimic the appearance of an ordered list, without semantically carrying the ordered weight. This is how I do it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;ul,
ol{
  margin-bottom:1.5em;
}
li ul,
li ol{
  margin-bottom:0;
}
ul{
  list-style:square outside;
}
ol,
&lt;mark&gt;.numbered&lt;/mark&gt;{
  list-style:decimal outside;
}&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There. As simple as that. These are pretty much my default list styles now, and all I'm really doing is making an unordered list with a class of <em>numbered</em> look the same as an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>.</p>
