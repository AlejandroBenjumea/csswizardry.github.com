            <p><a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/81748007304962048">I tweeted a tip</a> the other day whereby you add text styles to images so that their <code>alt</code> text is differentiated if images, for whatever reason, cannot be loaded.</p>

<p>The tweet sparked more interest than I expected so I thought I would give the technique a more thorough writeup. The CSS is incredibly simple but it's just one of those things that can make a lot of difference to someone's UX.</p>

<p>The thinking is that by applying text-styles to images you can affect their <code>alt</code> text and how that appears if the image fails to load. This can help users realise there's something different about a piece of content and that it's perhaps not directly a part of the current text.</p>

<p>A lot of people weren't aware this would or does work but if you think about it, any <code>alt</code> text you've ever seen will have been the same face, colour and style as the rest of the page. <code>alt</code> text (and therefore images) can be styled!</p>

<h2>The code</h2>

<p>I started doing this a long, long time ago but for some reason completely forgot about it until I started developing <a href="http://inuitcss.com">inuit.css</a>.</p>

<p>I tend to always apply italics to the text and oftentimes a text colour. Italics is fairly failsafe as figures and asides etc are often set in italics.</p>

<p>Text colours can be more troublesome as it could be misconstrued as being a link, so use this wisely and avoid using the same colour as your links appear in.</p>

<p>Another fairly progressive (but potentially unstable) addition is to use the <code>:after</code> pseudo-element to append the text '(image)' onto the <code>alt</code> text. This only seems to work in Firefox (4).</p>

<p>The code, in full, is simply:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;img{
    font-style:italic;
    color:#c00;
}

&lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;/*
In Firefox we can insert the word (image) into the alt text of an image that hasnâ€™t loaded.
*/&lt;/span&gt;
img:after   { content:" (image)"; }
img::after  { content:" (image)"; } &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;/* New CSS3 standard notation */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So there we have it, a simple, tiny addition to make your users' experience a little more polished and complete...</p>
